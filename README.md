# Hinglish-translator
**Description**

This repository contains a Hinglish (a mixture of Hindi and English) translator model. The model is designed to translate text from Hinglish to English or vice versa. This README file provides instructions on how to run the model and how to evaluate its performance.

**Usage**

Prerequisites

Before using the model, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

->Python (version 3.12.0)

->Tensorflow(version 1.41)

->Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)

->Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python development environment

->Pre-trained model weights (mBART or MarianMT)

**Running the Model**

1.Clone this repository to your local machine.

  **git clone https://github.com/Smrithiv28/hinglish-translator.git**
  
2.Navigate to the project directory.

  **cd hinglish-translator**
  
3.Install the required Python packages.

 **pip install -r requirements.txt**
 
4.Prepare your input data. You can use the provided sample data in the 'data' directory, or you can use your own data. The input should be in Hinglish.

5.Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script where the model is implemented.

6.Load the pre-trained model (if applicable) or train the model with your data.

7.Use the model to translate Hinglish text to English or vice versa.

**Evaluating Model Performance**

To evaluate the model's performance, follow these steps:

1.Prepare an evaluation dataset containing Hinglish and corresponding reference translations (in English or Hinglish, depending on your use case).

2.Use the model to translate the Hinglish sentences in the evaluation dataset.

3.Calculate performance metrics such as BLEU score, accuracy, or any other relevant evaluation metric for your specific use case.

4.Document the results in the README file.

**Example**

You can provide a code snippet or example of how to run the model and evaluate its performance in your specific context.

Statement: I had about a 30 minute demo just using this new headset

Output required: मझु ेसि र्फ ३० minute का demo मि ला था इस नयेheadset का इस्तमे ाल करनेके लिए

**Additional Notes**
1. Enhanced vocabulary for better translation.
2. Context awareness to handle nuances.
3. Improved error handling for user-friendly experience.
4. Integration with external language tools or APIs.
